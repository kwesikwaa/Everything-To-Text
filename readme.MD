# frontend/mobile
### built in reactNative
### signals for state management mainly to avoid rebuilds associated with useState
### image to text, voice to text, text to voice are all be handled by react-native libriaries
### storage is handled locally

# backend
### python, utilising openai's apis
### in this case i have both python and js apis. the python can be used to setup endpoints on a personal server to serve
### i decided to do all of that in the mobile app without hiting a seperate api for it. ie all done in js 

may look into redis or cloudflare dbs to keep history and reuse those as well
